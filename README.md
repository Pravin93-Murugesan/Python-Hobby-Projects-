Codes are created to:  
**1) Cryptanalyze Caeser Cipher**
      * Using the frequency distribution of the letters in the english language, it is possible to decode secret messages. One such             example ( a speech by Woodrow Wilson to the house of congress in 1917 ) is taken and decoded. 

**2) Organize files in a folder**
      * Using a directory dictionary and user-defined functions, files are segregated and placed into appropriate folders  
      
**3) Automate web scraping with Beautiful Soup**
      - Beautiful Soup package is needed to read HTML
      - With the 'Inspect' option in a web browser, it is possible to get information from webpages
      - Different python files are uploaded to get web content from a single webpage & multiple webpages  
      
**4) Automate web browsing with Selenium**
      - Selenium webdriver is needed to establish an interface with the web browser
      - Python files are uploaded to enter information, click buttons and drag/drop objects in a website  
      
**5) Automating with APIs requests**
      - There are endless reasons of making API calls
      - One can convert a barcode to product information
      - One can get weather updates
      - Python files showcasing the two mentioned cases are uploaded
